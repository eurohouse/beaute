        "memoir": "When its construction finished in 1883, the Justice Palace was the largest building in the world, and even today it is one of the most spectacular. Le Palais de Justice (The Palace of Justice) is one of the largest and most impressive buildings in the whole of Europe. It is currently still the most important court building in Belgium. Due to its cheer size; 160 by 150 meters and a total ground surface of 26,000 m¬≤ and its location on the high Town of Brussels, the building is visible from most parts of the town. The best views of Brussels are found on Poelaert Square, where the main entrance to the building is located. The building was constructed between 1866 and 1883 by Joseph Poelaert, who died four years before the Palace was inaugurated. For the building to be completed, 3,000 houses had to be torn down. At the end of World War II when the Germans were chased out of Belgium, they set fire to the Palace and the dome collapsed. The new dome is taller, narrower and very different from the original one."

Now, I‚Äôm trying to make it in the Big Apple (5 years and counting!). I‚Äôve got a case of travel bug that can‚Äôt be cured, so you‚Äôre equally as likely to find me on a plane as you are home. Although I travel frequently, returning to Manhattan is always as exciting as the first time. This city is something else. I recently graduated from my dream school, Parsons School of Design, with a Fashion Design BFA, and loved every single second of it. I started Eva Darling as ‚ÄúThe Preppy Ballerina‚Äù (collective cringe, I know) on my 14th birthday, in my parents‚Äô basement with a love for Lilly Pulitzer and a collection of questionable images from my iPod Touch 4. Nearly 10 years later, Eva Darling has transformed into a luxury travel and style website, where I aim to empower women to see the world solo and provide honest, reliable travel advice, while sharing on-trend feminine style. For my solo female travelers (or any traveler!) out there, I‚Äôm always an email away!"

When people come over to me when I‚Äôm eating, I‚Äôm always surprised they‚Äôre not like, ‚ÄòTiffany Haddish is an evil bitch.‚Äô‚Äù On getting bat mitzvahed on her 40th birthday: ‚ÄúI learned Hebrew and everything. I was doing those bar mitzvahs for like 11 years, so I was always learning things.‚Äù On how she was introduced to PopSockets: ‚ÄúTaylor Swift was the first one that got me into these things.

Needless to say, it has left its indelible mark on the culture of Europe. In comparison to how coffee is consumed in the United States, Europe still knows how to savor it. It is not a continent that takes kindly to pouring fresh brew into a Styrofoam or paper cup. For Europe, it is not merely about the product, that is the beverage. It is about an experience. We will see that it is every bit as much about the coffee house itself as it is about how the coffee is brewed and consumed. Many European coffee cultures, especially those of Western Europe (Spain, Portugal, France) are extremely similar. If we were to go in-depth in describing all of the intricacies of each European country's coffee culture, you‚Äôd be reading for hours. Today we will discuss the big players and influencers."
